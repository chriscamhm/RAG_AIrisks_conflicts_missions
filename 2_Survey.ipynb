This could also mean modifying the maintenance of reactors which could be catastrophic., The AI could fail to predict energy surges when they appear in uncommon situations (like a worldcup final when everyone watches TV, or a sudden heathwave when people turn AC on) and thus overload could happen. If the AI has absolute control over grid distribution then that could cause issues as well due to malfunctioning and not assigning the right amount of energy where needed., Malicious actors could take advantage of weaknesses in AI systems that manage grid load balancing or energy trading, potentially disrupting operations or influencing market outcomes. In maintenance systems, they might feed in false data to cause unnecessary repairs or conceal real problems, putting equipment and grid reliability at risk., AI automation may lead to job reductions or changes in workforce demand, while increased energy use from AI operations and a focus on efficiency over sustainability could negatively impact the environment., Privacy and security are important concerns for Korea Electric Power because their AI systems manage vital parts of the electricity grid and energy markets. If these systems were compromised or tampered with, it could lead to power outages, financial damage, or even safety risks at power plants, putting the country's energy stability at risk., Operators relying too much on AI for managing the grid might lose awareness of critical situations, leading to slower or incorrect responses. Technicians may not fully understand AI maintenance recommendations, causing them to ignore or wrongly override important alerts. Energy traders might follow AI suggestions without fully grasping the reasoning, which could lead to poor decisions., energy theft by using fake locations\\nleaking information to compepitors, leaking the location of clients\\nleaking the personal information of clients, overreliance to Ai automation\\nsystem failure can cause prolonged blackouts\",\n          \"Taking control of battery optimisation away from human specialists and placing it in the hands of an AI will result in humans having less control over the final result of the battery development, as well as giving them less opportunities to develop the skill, understanding of which is beneficial to the development of the battery before it is passed to the AI for optimisation. This may result in battery designs which are able to be optimised less being passed to the AI, which will not be able to optimise them to as high of a standard as otherwise., Failures of the AI to adequately manage the maintenance of chemical plants or severe failures to create safe battery compositions may result in damage not only to the company, but of chemical products to the environment., The AI may lack enough information regarding good battery composition practices, the effects of different compositions, or simply the reasoning skills to adequately optimise a battery composition. Hallucinated information used to make judgements poses a particular risk to the accuracy of its proposed optimisations., AI-based safety systems could reduce human vigilance, creating a false sense of security. Excessive automation may lead to loss of human decision-making authority, AI predictingg maintenance failures incorrectly could result in unplanned chemical plant shutdowns, AI may overlook local environmental or social factors in risk assessments, causing unfair outcomes. Over-optimization for performance might increase environmental impact. Reduced human oversight could neglect community health considerations., AI-driven safety monitoring might fail to detect critical hazards due to sensor errors or model limitations. Predictive maintenance inaccuracies could cause unexpected equipment breakdowns. Faulty AI decisions may increase risks to worker safety.\",\n          \"Chatbots can provide vague and unhelpful tips for solving customers' issues. Chatbots can provide customers with untrue solutions for less typical problems., Humans will not be checking whether demand forecasting is really true, in rare cases it could cause many bad things. The same in case of predictive analytics for supply chain optimization., If demand forecasting will be much different from reality, there will be huge losses for the firm. If value of predictive analytics differs much from reality, there will be huge losses for Walmart too because in these fields, the firm relies on AI., Customers may be misinformed when their specific issue is not addressed, Chat bots can be very limiting in terms of interaction. Customers may have specific needs not covered by chatbots., AI-driven support may produce incorrect customer help for customers, resulting in  dissatisfaction., AI areas may become controlling rather than a tool, Could cause problems in inventory management due to lack of transparency.
