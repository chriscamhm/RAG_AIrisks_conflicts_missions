actors could hack the system to convince the AI to cut the energy power. This could also mean modifying the maintenance of reactors which could be catastrophic., The AI could fail to predict energy surges when they appear in uncommon situations (like a worldcup final when everyone watches TV, or a sudden heathwave when people turn AC on) and thus overload could happen. If the AI has absolute control over grid distribution then that could cause issues as well due to malfunctioning and not assigning the right amount of energy where needed., Malicious actors could take advantage of weaknesses in AI systems that manage grid load balancing or energy trading, potentially disrupting operations or influencing market outcomes. In maintenance systems, they might feed in false data to cause unnecessary repairs or conceal real problems, putting equipment and grid reliability at risk., AI automation may lead to job reductions or changes in workforce demand, while increased energy use from AI operations and a focus on efficiency over sustainability could negatively impact the environment., Privacy and security are important concerns for Korea Electric Power because their AI systems manage vital parts of the electricity grid and energy markets. If these systems were compromised or tampered with, it could lead to power outages, financial damage, or even safety risks at power plants, putting the country's energy stability at risk., Operators relying too much on AI for managing the grid might lose awareness of critical situations, leading to slower or incorrect responses.
