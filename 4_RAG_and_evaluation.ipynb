Our SLR identiﬁed 612 scholarly papers on \\nAI use in PSFs, with a deeper dive into 75 papers from highly rated journals. Our \\ncontribution lies in the identiﬁcation and synthesis of ﬁve broad themes that per -\\nsist in the literature, which include the context for AI’s evolving role within PSFs; \\nthe challenges, risks and limitations faced by PSFs using AI; the impact of AI on \\nday-to-day operational and business practices of ﬁrms; human–AI interaction and'),\n",

PSFs contribute signiﬁcantly to social and economic development by \\nenhancing human capital, creating innovative services, and establishing standards \\nin legal, accounting, and ﬁnancial markets (Empson et\\xa0al., 2015b).

This is\\nbecause the deep function approximator needs multiple\\ngradient updates to converge, and target networks can\\nsupply a stable objective during the learning process. In the\\nabsence of a fixed target network, residual errors would\\naccumulate with each update. Therefore, target networks\\ncould be used to reduce the error of multiple gradient\\nupdates, and the policy updates based on high-error states\\nthat would lead to a good divergence. Then, the policy\\nnetwork should have a lower updating frequency than the\\nvalue network to minimize the estimation error before\\npolicy updates.

AI could also increase the relative footprint of non-bank\\\\nfinancial institutions (NBFIs) in certain markets, for example as a result of a greater use of\\\\nalgorithmic trading.

Its subdomains include False or misleading information and Pollution of information ecosystem and loss of consensus reality\\\\nPrivacy & Security: This domain encompasses risks related to the compromise of privacy through leaking or inferring sensitive information, and AI system security vulnerabilities and attacks. Its subdomains are Compromise of privacy by leaking or correctly inferring sensitive information and AI system security vulnerabilities and attacks\\\\nMalicious actors: This domain covers risks arising from the intentional exploitation of AI systems by malicious actors for harmful purposes. Its subdomains are Disinformation, surveillance, and influence at scale; Cyberattacks, weapon development or use, and mass harm; and Fraud, scams, and targeted manipulation\\\\nHuman- Computer Interaction: This domain pertains to risks related to how humans interact with AI systems, such as becoming overly reliant on them or experiencing a loss of their own agency and autonomy. Its subdomains are Overreliance and unsafe use and Loss of human agency and autonomy\\\\nSocioeconomic & Environmental: This domain addresses the broader societal and environmental impacts of AI, including issues of power centralization, increased inequality, the economic and cultural devaluation of human effort, competitive dynamics, governance failures, and environmental harm.
