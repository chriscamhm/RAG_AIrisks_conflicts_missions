The predictive fraud detection type cannot accurately identify innovative fraud trends, causing substantial financial losses. The excessive use of historical data in the risk models may restrict the response to the economic changes experienced.",Risks: Fraud detection predictive analytics is subject to adversarial influences where the details of financial information can be masked by intentionally feeding erroneous data into the predictive analytics models. Chatbots based on AI may disclose personal or spent information as a result of a reconfigured API or an attack. One way of reverse-engineering credit risk models would be to deduce secret client profiles or the financial behaviour profile.,,Risks: The excessive use of chatbots might cause customers to neglect human consultants and fail to make necessary considerations in some complicated issues. Users can believe that the advice provided by AI is unquestionable and follow it without checking it. It takes away the chance to provide customised service regarding delicate financial matters.,"Risks: Automation of client services with the help of AI, such as chatbots, may decrease the demand for entry-level banking jobs and affect employment quality. High levels of dependence on AI systems can denounce human judgement in attaining creditworthiness judgements, which would decrease clients' trust. There is a potential to escalate compute-intensive fraud models, which can boost energy consumption in data centres.","Risk: insufficient, biased data in credit risk assessment based on AI can't distinguish between high and low risks properly, resulting in the system rejecting loan applications to low-risk customers. Predictive fraud detection can miss the detection of new fraud patterns, leading to a considerable loss of money. Excessive emphasis on past data in the risk models may restrict flexibility when changes are experienced in the economy.",Yes,"The practice of imbalanced credit score cards that discriminate against marginalised groups undermines the mission of the bank to achieve lasting success and financial security for all clients. Discrimination practices have a de-legitimising effect on the realisation of equal economic opportunity, which is a key contributor to the client's long-term success.",Yes,"Even incorrect information produced by AI, including false fraud notices or wrong credit ratings, can put a client at risk of losing financial security and access to service facilities. These problems undermine trust, and this factor adversely affects the future prosperity of the Deutsche Bank customers.",Yes,Any breaches done by chatbots or predictive analytics break clients' data and undermine the trustworthiness to ensure financial prosperity. Breakage of confidentiality and disclosure of sensitive financial behaviour directly undermines the mission on financial security of the clients.,,,Yes,Excessive use of chatbots without proper human support may deny the clients the necessary individual advice at the expense of their financial performance. The failure to offer individual support during complicated circumstances goes against the intention of the bank to make the clients successful in the long run.,Yes,"A decrease in employment quality, excessive automation of working with clients, may undermine service quality and its image, which, in turn, will hurt client trust and long-term sustainability. Moreover, irresponsible energy consumption negates a responsible perspective toward future financial stability.",Yes,"The incorrect risk estimations or forecasting schemes may result in the loss of credit access among clients or economic loss due to fraud unnoticed by the model. Such weaknesses threaten both the monetary stability and the prosperity of Deutsche Bank, which it promises to safeguard.","Discrimination & Toxicity: This domain addresses the unequal treatment of individuals or groups by AI, often based on sensitive characteristics, which can lead to unfair outcomes or misrepresentation, as well as AI that exposes users to harmful, abusive, unsafe, or inappropriate content.

Batches filtered by automated systems may filter batches on biased data that do not consider regional diversity in agricultural conditions, entrenching current supply chain inequities.",Broken AI-based predictions could give farmers or suppliers false hope that they will achieve unrealistic production volumes and can alter downstream logistics and pricing. The report produced by AI on quality control might be a matter of misunderstanding or false confidence of the downstream food processors. Inventory dashboards can depict the incorrect availability stipulated by the inaccurate AI analysis of the obsolete sensor information.,"AI-driven quality assessment tools may favour certain crop appearances or grades, disadvantaging small-scale or diverse farmers whose products fall outside narrowly trained quality profiles. Automated systems might reject batches based on biased datasets that do not account for regional agricultural diversity, reinforcing existing supply chain inequities.",,,,"The use of AI-based crop yield forecasting may not work under high climate conditions, resulting in ineffective planning and a lack of supplies. The systems of quality control can fail to recognise contaminated products, or even flawed products, and declare them as safe products, which leads to health hazards. The multi-regional supply variances that exist risk disrupting global food chains through allocations of inventory and inventory breakdown within an inventory system.",Yes,Discriminative AI model tools that promote homogeneous crop quality and denigrate heterogeneous or small-scale producers contradict the spirit of a re-imagined agriculture that is inclusive. Such risks help preserve old food system disparities instead of changing them.,Yes,"Wrong AI-based predictions on yields, inventories, or quality may skew supply chains, subortage food logistics, and diminish confidence in the use of intelligent agricultural systems. This goes against the mission to transform the food systems with smart, confident, and responsible innovation.",Yes,"AI systems facilitate unauthorised access to proprietary data on farms or when approaching the supply, which undermines trust in each other and cooperative agrarian change. To re-imagine global agriculture, the safe use of confidential agricultural and supplier information is critical to the mission.",,,,,,,Yes,"AI-driven prediction and quality control failures in crops weaken the credibility of the systems driven by AI. Dangerous or improper systems can threaten food integrity and waste of resources and negatively affect reputations, a direct challenge to the re-imagining of the food system through responsible innovation.","Privacy & Security: This domain encompasses risks related to the compromise of privacy through leaking or inferring sensitive information, and AI system security vulnerabilities and attacks.

Smart outage detection solutions powered by artificial intelligence may be susceptible to hacking at grid command centres, with the possibility of a massive power failure. It is possible to infer confidential data about the energy consumption pattern in businesses and government by using the predictive models.",,"In such a real-time crisis, operators can be blinded by dependence on automated outage detection and inadequate situational awareness. Human technicians can even skip the manual inspections due to the voluntary ignorance of predictive maintenance powered by the AI, which raises the chance of failure risks being neglected. Automation can result in a loss of skills by grid employees whose tasks include solving complicated situations with faults.","The efficiency steps that can be undertaken with the help of AI would instead focus on demands in urban or high-income areas, thus worsening the inequality in energy access in the rural or low-income areas. Data centres are driven by intense computational forecasting models that may raise energy consumption against sustainability targets. The threat of job replacement due to the application of predictive maintenance systems in the place of conventional inspection jobs is possible.","The outage detection using AI can misinterpret rare fault forms, resulting in unresponsive emergencies and extending the duration of blackouts. Catching predictive maintenance models can wrongly categorise the initial indicators of transformer degeneration and result in the surprise of failure of the equipment. In volatile conditions (e.g., natural disasters), energy consumption forecasting mechanisms might not perform to the best of their abilities, leading to inefficient use of grid resources.",,,,,Yes,"Yes. Any energy consumption invasion or attacks on smart grids compromise the faith of the population in the power system. This is a direct contravention of the effort set to serve the people; when their personal data security is jeopardised, their power supply is also put into question.",,,Yes,"Dependence on automated systems that would cause a loss of operators' skills or lead to inability to manage emergencies poses a risk that jeopardises power delivery to people, especially in a critical time. This undermines the company's integrity in maintaining a state of people power to the people, given that humanness is needed to complement the quality of service delivery.",Yes,"Prioritizing the city energy demands over the rural equity, the potential loss of jobs, and the elevated pressure on the environment because of producing AI with the help of the processing are all contrary to the mission of equity and inclusive of the people. The result of these effects is detrimental to the community instead of empowering.",Yes,"The inability to see the faults or errors in maintenance predictions may result in power loss or ineffective grid control, which directly correlates with the city's reliability and sustainability.
